 Configures Factual's Engine SDK to send Braze custom events whenever either
 Engine's circumstance or user journey events are triggered. Note that
 this method assumes that both SDKs have already been started.

 The following three types of custom events may be sent:
 
 1) Circumstance Triggered Events:
    Description: Sent when a Engine circumstance is triggered
    EventName: "engine_" + CIRCUMSTANCE_NAME
    EventProperties: incidence_id, user_latitude, user_longitude, event_source
 
 2) Circumstance At Place Events:
    Description: Sent for each place the user may have been at which triggered the circumstance event
    EventName: "engine_at_" + CIRCUMSTANCE_NAME
    EventProperties: Same as (1) with the addition of place properties: name, factual_id, latitude, longitude, place_categories, chain
 
 3) Circumstance Near Place Events:
    Description: Sent for each place the user may have been near to - but not at - which triggered the circumstance event
    EventName: "engine_near_" + CIRCUSMTANCE_NAME
    EventProperties: Same as (2)
 
 For each circumstance that is triggered there will be one event of type (1) and potentially
 multiple events of type (2) and type (3). Based on the generality of the circumstance definition,
 Factual's Engine SDK may match multiple potential candidate places the user may have been at or
 near when the circumstance was triggered.
