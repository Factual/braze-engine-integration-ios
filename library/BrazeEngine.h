 Sends a CircumstanceResponse to Braze as a custom event.  This method assumes that Braze has already been started.

 1) Circumstance Triggered Events:
 
    - Description: Circumstance
 
    - EventName: "engine_" + CIRCUMSTANCE_NAME
 
    - EventProperties: incidence_id, user_latitude, user_longitude, event_source
 
 2) Circumstance At Place Events:
 
    - Description: Sent for each place the user may have been at which triggered the circumstance event
 
    - EventName: "engine_at_" + CIRCUMSTANCE_NAME
 
    - EventProperties: Same as (1) with the addition of place properties: name, factual_id, latitude, longitude, place_categories, chain
 
 3) Circumstance Near Place Events:
 
    - Description: Sent for each place the user may have been near to - but not at - which triggered the circumstance event
 
    - EventName: "engine_near_" + CIRCUSMTANCE_NAME
 
    - EventProperties: Same as (2)
 
 For each circumstance response sent there will be one event of type (1) and a maximum of 10 events of type (2) and a
 maximum of 20 events of type (3).  If you wish to send more or less events of type (2) and (3) use the method
 pushToBraze:withMaxAtPlaceEvents:withMaxNearPlaceEvents.
 
 Based on the generality of the circumstance definition, Factual's Engine SDK may match multiple potential candidate
 places the user may have been at or near when the circumstance was triggered.
