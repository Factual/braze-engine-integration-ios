/**
 Configures Factual's Engine SDK to send Braze custom events whenever either
 Engine's circumstance or user journey events are triggered. Note that
 this method assumes that both Braze and Engine SDKs have already been started.

 The following three types of custom events may be sent to Braze:
 
 1) User Journey Events:
    Description: Sent when Engine detects a user journey event
    EventName: "engine_user_journey"
    EventProperties: user location and place properties
 
 2) Circumstance Triggered Events:
    Description: Sent when a Engine circumstance is triggered
    EventName: "engine_circumstance_" + CIRCUMSTANCE_NAME;
    EventProperties: incidenceId, user location
 
 3) Place At Circumstance Triggered Events:
    Description: Sent for each place at which the user may have been when the circumstance was triggered
    EventName: "engine_circumstance_place_at_" + CIRCUMSTANCE_NAME;
    EventProperties: incidenceId, user location, place properties
 
 For each circumstance that is triggered there will be one event of type (2) and potentially
 multiple events of type (3). Based on the generality of the circumstance definition,
 Factual's Engine SDK may match multiple potential candidate places the user
 may have been at when the circumstance was triggered.
 
 @param userJourneyEnabled whether Engine's user journey events should trigger a Braze event
 @param maxPlaceAtEventsPerCircumstance max number of PlaceAt events to send to Braze. Sent in order of decreasing confidence.
